//
//Implement a group of C++ classes that implements a deck and hand of Warzone cards. Each card has a type
//from: bomb, reinforcement, blockade, airlift and diplomacy. The Deck class must have a draw() method that
//allows a player to draw a card at random from the cards remaining in the deck and place it in their hand of cards.
//The objects of type Card must have a play() method that is called to play the card, which creates an order and
//adds it to the playerâ€™s list of orders and then returns the card to the deck. All the classes/functions that you
//implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named Cards.cpp/Cards.h. You must
//deliver a file named CardsDriver.cpp file that contains a free function named testCards() that creates a deck
//of Warzone cards, then create a hand object that is filled by drawing cards from the deck.
