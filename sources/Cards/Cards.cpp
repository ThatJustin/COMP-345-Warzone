//
//Implement a group of C++ classes that implements a deck and hand of Warzone cards. _/
//Each card has a type from: bomb, reinforcement, blockade, airlift and diplomacy. _/
//The Deck class must have a draw() method that allows a player to draw a card at random from the cards remaining in the deck _/
//and place it in their hand of cards. _/
//The objects of type Card must have a play() method that is called to play the card, which creates an order and
//adds it to the playerâ€™s list of orders and then returns the card to the deck.
//All the classes/functions that you implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named Cards.cpp/Cards.h._/
//You must deliver a file named CardsDriver.cpp file that contains a free function named testCards() that creates a deck of Warzone cards,
//then create a hand object that is filled by drawing cards from the deck.
