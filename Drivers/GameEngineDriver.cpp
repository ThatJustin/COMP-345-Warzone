/**
 * You must deliver a driver as a free function named testMainGameLoop() that demonstrates that:
 * (1) a player receives the correct number of army units in the reinforcement phase (showing different cases);
 * (2) a player will only issue deploy orders and no other kind of orders if they still have army units in their reinforcement pool;
 * (3) a player can issue advance orders to either defend or attack, based on the toAttack() and toDefend() lists;
 * (4) a player can play cards to issue orders;
 * (5) a player that does not control any territory is removed from the game;
 * (6) the game ends when a single player controls all the territories. All of this must be implemented in a single
 * .cpp/.h file duo named GameEngine.cpp/GameEngine.h, except the issueOrder() method, which is a member 5 of the Player class,
 * implemented in the Player.h/Player.h file duo. This driver function must be in the GameEngineDriver.cpp file.
